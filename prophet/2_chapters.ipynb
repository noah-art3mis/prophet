       "'I have the impression that last trimester - I had some feedback - I left you a little bit out of breath. I did not notice, otherwise I would not have done it. I also have the impression that I have been repeating myself, that I have not been making much progress. However this did not prevent perhaps some things that I wanted to tell from getting lost along the way. It is worthwhile perhaps to go back a little, to take a look at the way that I tackled things this year. What I am trying to show you in connection with the witticism, of which I separated out a certain schema whose usefulness may perhaps not be immediately apparent to you, is its unity, how things fit together, how they mesh in with the preceding schema. When all is said and done it is a question of something which you should perceive as a constant in what I teach you. Again it would be appropriate that this constant should not simply be something like a little flag on the horizon, with regard to which you take your bearings. It is necessary that you should understand where this is leading you, into what detours it leads you. This constant is the remark which I believe to be absolutely fundamental for understanding what is in Freud, that of the importance of language, as we said first, and then of the word. And the more we approach our object the more we perceive where the difference is of the importance of the signifier in the economy of desire, or let us rather say in the formation, the informing of the signified. You were able to see it last night, in listening to the interesting things Madame Pankow contributed to our scientific meeting. It happens that in America people are concerned with the same thing as I am explaining to you here. They are trying to introduce as essential into the determination of these psychic disturbances, these economic disturbances, the fact of communication and what they call in this instance the message. You were able to hear Madame Pankow telling you about someone who did not come down in the last shower, namely Mr. Bateson, an anthropologist and ethnographer, who has contributed something which makes us reflect a little bit beyond the tips of our noses about therapeutic action. He tries to formulate something which is at the source of the genesis of psychotic problems, in something which is set up between the mother and the child, and which is not simply an effect of tension, or retention, of defence, of ratification, of frustration in the elementary sense that I am specifying, of interhuman relationships, as if it were something which happened at the end of a piece of elastic, who tries from the beginning to put the notion of communication in so far as it is centred not simply on a contact, on a relationship, with an entourage, but on a signification, to put it at the origin of the originally discordant, disruptive thing which has happened in what links the child in his relationships with the mother, and when he designates, when he denotes as being the discordant element of this relationship, the fact that communication presents itself in the form of the double relationship as Madame Pankow told you very clearly last night, by telling you that in the same message which is the one in which the child has deciphered the behaviour of his mother, in the same message there are two elements which are not defined with respect to one another, in this sense simply that one presents itself as forbidding ( dÃ©fense ) the subject what the other means, which is the usual notion that we have in what happens at the level of the mechanism of the defence that you analyse.   You can say what the subject says, in order to overlook that there is some share of signification in him. He misleads himself just as he misleads you. This is not what is in question. It is a question of something which concerns the other and which is received by the other in such a way that if he responds on one point, he knows by that very fact that he is going to find himself caught in the other. As Madame Pankow told us last night, if I respond to the declaration of love which my mother makes to me, I will provoke her withdrawal, and if I do not hear her as such, namely if I do not respond to her, I will lose her. You see therefore that we are thus introduced into this dialectic of double meaning, in the fact that already it involves a third element. It is not one behind the other, namely something which is beyond meaning, a meaning which would have this privilege of being the more authentic of the two simultaneous messages in the same emission, as one might say, of signification which creates in the subject a position such that he is in an impasse. This proves to you that even in America, enormous progress is being made. Does that mean that it is fully sufficient? Madame Pankow last night underlined very well the basic, empirical nature of this attempt. Naturally it is not at all a question of empiricism. If in America there were not also studies which are very important, which are conducted on the plane of what is called games strategy, they would not even have dreamt of introducing this something into analysis, which is all the same here a reconstruction of something which is supposed to have happened at the beginning, and determines this profoundly painful position of the subject who is in a false position vis-Ã  -vis precisely what is constitutive in the message for the subject. If this position does not imply that the message is something constitutive for the subject, one can scarcely see how it would be possible to attribute such enormous effects to this primitive double relationship. Thus the question which arises is that of knowing what will be the situation, what wi ll be the process of communication in so far as it does not succeed in being constitutive for the subject. It is another reference point that must be sought. Up to the present when you read and when you hear what Mr. Bateson means, you see that everything in fact is centred on the double message, no doubt, but on the double message qua double signification. It is precisely here that the system fails, and precisely in what? In the following: it is that there is another way of conceiving things, of presenting them, than this one which precisely neglects the constitutive role of the signifier in signification. Last night I took a note in passing, which I do not have now, which I gathered from the very remarks of Madame Pankow, and which amounts to more or less this: There is no word, she said, which can ground the word qua act. And this is right along the path of what I am approaching now. Among these words, there must be one which grounds the word qua act in the subject. It is in this sense that she showed her exactingness, her feeling that the system was insufficient. It is in this that Madame Pankow showed an exigency for the stabilisation of the whole system, from the fact that within the word there is somewhere something which grounds the word qua true. She addressed herself therefore in this sense to having recourse to the perspective of personality. This is what she contributed last night, and it is indeed something which has at least the merit of witnessing to a certain exigency corresponding to   something which, in the system, leaves us uncertain, does not permit us a sufficient construction, or deduction. I absolutely do not think that this is the way in which it can be formulated. I do not believe that this personalist reference is psychologically founded except in this sense that we cannot but sense that in this impasse which the significations create, in so far as it is supposed to trigger off a profound disturbance in the subject when he is schizophrenic, we cannot help sensing that there is something which must be at the origin of this deficit. It is not simply the established, grasped, imprinted, experience of these impasses of meanings, but also something which is the lack of something which grounds signification itself, and which is the signifier, and something still more which is precisely what I am going to approach today, namely something which is grounded, not simply as personality, as something which grounds the word qua act, as Madame Pankow was saying last night, but something which is posed a s what gives authority to the law. We call law here, precisely what is articulated strictly at the level of the signifier, namely the text of the law. It is not the same to say that there is a person who must be there to sustain as one might say the authenticity of the word, and to say that there is something which authorises the text of the law, because this something which authorises the text of the law is something which is sufficient in itself at the level of the signifier, namely the name of the father, what I call the name of the father, namely the symbolic father. This is something which subsists at the level of the signifier. It is something which in the other in so far as it is the seat of the law, represents this other in the other, the signifier which gives support to the law, which promulgates the law. It is precisely what is explained by the myth that is necessary for Freud\\'s thought, the myth of Oedipus. The reason why - pay very careful attention to this - it is necessary that he obtain for himself in this mythical form, the origin of the law, is so that there should be something which ensures that the law is grounded in the father. There must be the murder of the father. The two things are closely linked, namely that the father in so far as he promulgates the law is the dead father, namely the symbol of the father; the dead father is the name of the father, which is here constructed on the content. This is altogether essential. I am going to take the opportunity of reminding you why. Around what did I centre everything that I taught you about psychosis two years ago? Around something which I called Verwerfung . I tried to make you see it as something which is different to VerdrÃ¤ngung , namely the fact that the signifying chain continues, whether you know it or not, to be unfolded, to be arranged in the other, this being essentially the Freudian discovery. But I told you that the Verwerfung was something which was not simply beyond your reach, namely in the Other qua repressed and qua signifier. That is what VerdrÃ¤ngung is. But it is the signifying chain, the proof of this is that it continues to act without you giving it the least signification. It determines the least signification without your knowing it as signifying chain. I also told you that there is something else which in this instance is Verwerfung . There can be in the chain of signifiers a signifier or a letter which is missing, which is always   missing in the typography, because it is a question of a typographical space. The space of the signifier, the space of the unconscious is a typographical space. We must try to define typographical space as something which constitutes itself in a line, in little squares. There are topological laws of the typographical space. There is something missing in this chain of signifiers. You should understand the importance of the lack of the particular signifier that I have just spoken to you about, which is the name o f the father in so far precisely as it grounds as such the fact that there is law, namely the articulation of the signifier in a certain order; the Oedipus complex, or the oedipal law, or the law of the prohibition of the mother, for example the signifier which signifies that within this signifier, the signifier exists. That is what the name of the father is, and as you see, it is an essential signifier within the other, it is around this that I tried to centre for you what happens in psychosis, namely how the subject must make up for the lack of this signifier, for the essential signifier which is the name of the father, and it is around this that I tried to order for you everything that I called the chain reaction, or the dispersal which occurs in psychosis. What should I do here? Should I get involved right away in this reminder of what I told you about President Schreber? Or should I show you in a still more precise fashion what I am articulating, what I have just simply announced here, by showing you in detail what relationship I should articulate for you at the level of this year\\'s schema, which to my great surprise, does not interest everybody; but which all the same interests some of you, and at the level of this year\\'s schema, to try to articulate for you what I have just tried to indicate to you? Do not forget that this schema was constructed to portray for you what happens at the level of something which deserves the name of technique, the technique of the witticism, which is something particular, quite singular because obviously it can be carried out in the most unintentional way in the world by the subject, that as I showed you, the witticism is sometimes only the other side of a parapraxis and that experience shows that many witticisms arise in that way, you realize afterwards that you were witty. It happened all by itself. At first it could be taken in certain cases as being exactly the contrary, a sign of naivetÃ©. I made an allusion the last day to the naive witticism. It was around the witticism and its result which is the satisfaction which is peculiar to it, that I tried last trimester, to organise this schema for you, to try to locate how we could conceive the origin of this special satisfaction that it gives. This made us go back to nothing other than the dialectic of the demand beginning from the ego. Remember the schema of what I can call the primordial symbolic ideal, which is quite inexistent at the moment of the satisfied demand in so far as it is represented by the simultaneity of the intention, in so far as it is going to be manifested in a message, and the arrival of this message as such at the other, I mean the fact that the signifier, because this chain is the signifying chain, reaches the other. He sees as such whether there is a perfect identity, simultaneity, exact superposition between the manifestation of the intention, in so far as it is that of the ego, and the fact that the signifier is as such ratified in the other, this something which is at the source of the very possibility of the satisfaction of the word. We suppose therefore - this is what I call the ideal primordial moment - that if this moment exists, it must be constituted by this simultaneity, this exact co-extension of the desire in so far as it is manifested and the signifier in so far as it carries and implies it. If this moment exists, what   follows, namely something which here is going to succeed to the message, is something which is going to succeed to its passage over into the other, which is going to correspond to what is necessary, and to what is realised in the other and in the subject in order that there should be satisfaction. This is very precisely the necessary point of departure for you to understand that this never happens. Namely that it is of the nature and the effect of the signifier that what arrives here, is presented as signified, namely as something which is made up of the transformation, of the refraction of his desire by its passage through the signifier, and why? Because this is the reason why the two lines are intersecting; it is to make you see the fact that desire is expressed by and passes through the signifier, namely that it crosses the signifying line, and that at the level of this intersection of desire and the signifying line, it encounters what? It encounters the other. We will see later, because it will be necessary to come back to it, what this other is in this schema. It encounters the other, I did not say to you as a person - it encounters the other as the treasury of the signifier, as the seat of the code. In other words, this is where the refraction of desire by the signifier happens. Desire arrives therefore as signified different from what it was at the beginning, and this is why not that your daughter is mute, but why your desire is always cuckolded. It is because in the interval, what is in question shows you that it is rather you who are cuckolded; you are yourself betrayed in that your desire has slept with the signifier. This is essential. I do not know how I can articulate things better, to make you understand them. This is because of the fact that desir e qua emanation, springs from a moment of this radical ego, from the very fact that it is this path here. This is where the signification of the schema lies. It is there to visualise for you this concept that the passage across the chain of the signifier introduces of itself this essential change into the dialectic of desire. So it is quite clear that for the satisfaction of desire, everything depends on what happens at that point first defined as the locus of the code, as this essential something which already by itself from the beginning, ab origine , by the very fact of its structure as signifier, brings about this essential nodification of desire at the level of its crossing of the signifier. Here everything else is implied, because there is not just the code, there is indeed something else. I am situating myself here at the most radical level, but of course there is the law, there are prohibitions, there is the super-ego, etc. But to understand how these different levels are built up, you must understand that already at the most radical level, in so far as once you speak to someone there is an other other in him, qua subject of the code, already we find ourselves subjected to this dialectic of the cuckolding of desire. Therefore everything depends, it appears, on what happens at this crossing point, at this level of breaking through. It emerges that every possible satisfaction of human desire is thus going to depend on the harmony of the signifying system in so far as it is articulated in the word of the subject, and Monsieur de la Palice would tell you, of the system of the signifier qua reposing in the code, or at the level of the other qua locus and seat of the code. A little child hearing that would be convinced of it, and I do not claim that what I have explained to you makes us take one step further. Still it must be articulated.   It is here that we are going to approach the connection that I want you to make between this schema and the essential things that I announced to you above concerning the important question of the name of the father. You are going to see it being prepared, being delineated, and not being generated, or especially not being generated by itself, but rather the jump that it must take to arrive, because not everything happens at the level of continuity, the characteristic of the signifier being precisely to be discontinuous. What does the technique of the witticism contribute to our experience? This is what I am trying to make you see, in all sorts of ways, it is something which while not involving any particular immediate satisfaction, consists in the fact that something happens in the other which is equivalent, which represents, which symbolises what can be called the necessary condition for every satisfaction, namely that you are precisely heard beyond what you say, because in no case can what you say really make you understood. The witticism as such, develops in the dimension of metaphor, namely that it is beyond the signifier, in so far as through it you seek to signify something, that despite everything you always signify something else. It is precisely in something which is going to present itself as a stumbling of the signifier, that you are satisfied, simply in this that in that sign the other recognises this dimension beyond where there should be signified what is in question, and what you cannot as such signify. This is the dimension that the witticism reveals to us, and it is important, it grounds in experience this schema because we necessarily had to construct it, to account for what happens in the witticism, namely that this something which substitutes to the point of giving us a sort of happiness at the failure of the communication of desire by way of the signifier, is something which, in the witticism, is realised in the following fashion: the fact is that the other ratifies a message as interrupted, as having failed, and by this very interruption as recognising the dimension beyond in which the true desire is situated, namely what does not manage to be signified because of the signifier. You see that the dimension of the other here extends however little, because it is no longer simply here the seat of the code - here it intervenes as subject, ratifying a message in the code, complicating it, namely that here already it is at the level of the one who constitutes the law as such, because it is capable of adding to it this trait, this message as supplementary, namely as itself designating the beyond of the message. That is why I began this year, when what was in question were the formations of the unconscious, by talking to you about the witticism. Let us try to look more closely in a less unusual situation than that of the witticism, at this other in so far as we seek to discover in its dimension the necessity of this signifier, in so far as it grounds the signifier, namely in so far as it is the signifier which establishes the legitimacy of the law or of the code. To take up again our dialectic of desire, we are not always going to be expressing ourselves in witticisms, when we address ourselves to the other. If we could do so, we would be happier in a certain way. This is, for a short part of the discourse that I address to you, what I try to do. I do not always succeed. It may be your fault or it may be mine, but it is absolutely indistinguishable from that point of view.   But in fact on the down to earth plane of what happens when I address the other, there is a dimension which allows us to ground it in the most elementary fashion at the level of the conjunction of and this signifier of the other. It is a word which is absolutely marvellous in French, because of all the equivocations that it allows, and for all the puns that I myself blush at having made use of, even though in the most discrete fashion. Once I have said the word, you will remember immediately, the sort of evocation that I am referring to. It is the word tu. This tu is absolutely essential in what I called on many occasions the full word, the word in so far as it grounds something in history, the tu of \"thou are my master\", or \"thou art my wife\". This tu, is the signifier of the appeal to the other, this other whom I showed you - and I remind those who followed the whole chain of my seminars on psychosis the use that I made of it - the demonstration that I tried to bring to life before you in terms of the distance between tu es celui qui me suivras , and the tu es celui qui me suivra . In other words, what I was already at that time approaching for you, what I was trying to get you to practice, is precisely what I am alluding to now, and what I had already given a name to. There is in these two terms, with their difference, and more in one than in the other, and even completely in one and not at all in the other, an appeal. In the tu es celui qui me suivras , there is something which is not in the tu es celui qui me suivra . And this is called invocation. If I say tu est celui qui me suivras , I invoke you, I designate you, I designate you as being the one who follows me, I stimulate in you the \"yes\" which says \"I am for you\", \"I dedicate myself to you\", \"I am the one who shall follow you\". But if I say: tu est celui qui me suivra, I do nothing of the kind. I announce, I affirm, I objectify, and even on occasion I reject. That can mean: \"You are the one who is still following me, and I am fed up with it\". It is even in the most ordinary fashion, the most important in which this is pronounced, a refusal. Invocation is something which of course requires a whole other dimension, namely precisely that I should make my desire depend on your being, in this sense that I call on it to enter onto the path of this desire whatever it may be, in an unconditional way. It is this process of invocation, in this sense that it means that I appeal to the voice, namely to what supports the word, not to the word, but to the subject, precisely in so far as he carries it, and that is why at this level I am at the level of what I called above, in speaking about Madame Pankow, the personalist level. This indeed is why the personalis ts repeatedly put the tu, tu, tu before you all day long. Mr. Martin Buber for example, whose name Madame Pankow pronounced in passing, is in effect an eminent name in this register. Of course there is here an essential phenomenological level, and we cannot avoid it. But neither must we yield to its mirage alone, namely prostrate ourselves, because it is here that effectively we encounter a little of this danger at the level of this personalist attitude which leads easily enough into mystical prostration. And why not? We do not refuse any attitude whatsoever to people, we simply demand the right to understand them, which moreover the personalists do not refuse us, but which is refused by the scientists, because if you begin to attach an authenticity to the subjective structure of what a mystic tells you, the scientist considers that you are also falling into a ridiculous complacency. While it seems to me that every subjective structure, whatever it is, in the measure that we can follow what it articulates, is strictly equivalent from the point of view of subjective analysis to any other, namely that only cretinous imbeciles of the style of Mr. Blondel (the psychiatrist), can bring forward as an objection, in the name of a so called ineffable, experienced \"morbid consciousness\" of the other, something which appears to be   not ineffable, but articulated. This ought to be refused as such, because of the confusion which comes from the fact that it is believed that what is being articulated is precisely what is beyond, although it is nothing of the kind. It is what is beyond that articulates it. In other words, it is wrong to talk about ineffable as regards this subject, whether he is deluded or mystical. We are at the level of the subjective structure of something which as such cannot present itself in a different way from the way that it does present itself, and which as such in consequence, presents itself with its entire value at its level of credibility. If there is something ineffable in either the deluded or the mystical person, by definition he does not speak about it because it is ineffable. Therefore we do not have to judge what he articulates, namely his word on what he cannot talk about it. If it is supposable, and we are quite willing to suppose it, th at the ineffable does exist, we would never refuse in the name of the ineffable to grasp what appears as structure in a word, whatever it is. We can get lost in it, and then we give up on it; but if we do not get lost in it, the order that it demonstrates and that it unveils is to be taken as such, and we perceive in general that it is infinitely more fruitful to take it as such and to try to articulate the order that it poses, on condition that you have the proper reference points. This is what we are trying to do here: we start from the idea that it was essentially made to represent the signified. We are immediately swamped, because we again fall into the preceding oppositions, namely that we do not know the signified. This tu that is in question is what we invoke, but in invoking it is all the same this personal subjective impenetrability which of course will be involved, but it is not at this level that we try to reach it. We try to give it what is involved in every invocation. The word invocation has a historical usage, it is what made its appearance in a certain ceremony among the ancients, who had more wisdom on certain matters, that they performed before battle. This ceremony consisted in doing what was necessary, they probably knew it, to get the gods of the others on their side. This is exactly what invocation means, and it is in this that there resides the essential relationship to which I now lead you, of this necessary second stage, of the appeal in order that desire and demand should be satisfied. It is not enough simply to say to him: tu, tu, tu, and to have it accompanied by a thrill, it is a question precisely of giving him the same voice that we desire him to have, to evoke this voice which is present precisely in the witticism, at least as its proper dimension. The witticism is a provocation which does not succeed by a great display of force, by the great miracle of invocation. It is at the level of the word, and in so far as it is a matter of this voice being articulated in conformity with our desire, that the invocation is situated. We then rediscover at this level, the following which is that every satisfaction of demand, in so far as it depends on the other, is thus going to depend on what is happening here, namely in this revolving coming and going from the message to the code, and from the code to the message, which permits my message to be authenticated in the code by the other. We come back to the preceding point, namely to what constitutes the essence of the interest that together we are giving this year to the witticism. I would just simply point out to you in passing that had you had this schema, namely if I had been able not to present it to you, but to construct it for you at that time, in other words, if we had come together at the same time to this same witticism, I would have been able on this schema to picture for you what essentially is happening to President Schreber, in so far as he had become the prey of, the subject absolutely dependent on his voices.   If you observe attentively the schema which is behind me, and if you simply suppose that there is Verwerfung , everything that can respond in the other in any way at all at this level, which I call the level of the name of the father, which incarnates, specifies, particularises, I know, but particularises what? What I have just delineated for you, which in the other should present the other, qua giving its import to the law. If you suppose that it is absent, which is the definition that I gave you of the Verwerfung of the name of the father, you would perceive that the two meeting points that I circled here, namely the going and coming of the message to the code and of the code to the message, are by that very fact destroyed and impossible, and that this allows you to carry forward to this schema the two fundamental types of voice phenomena which appear as a substitution for this fault, for this lack in so far precisely as it was once evoked. Here is the balancing point, the turning point which precipitates the subject into psychosis, and I am leaving to one side for the moment how and at what time, and why it is subsequently, in the emptiness, in the vacuum brought about by the fact that precisely what is called for at a given moment at the level of the Tu es - nom du PÃ¨re, and that this name of the father, in so far as it is capable of ratifying the message, is the guarantor, that there appears what you can then see on this schema, namely what is produced as autonomous, and because of this fact, that the law as such appears as autonomous. I began my discourse on psychosis that year in connection with a sentence in one of my case presentations which I told you about, in which one could grasp very well the moment at which the sentence murmured by the patient: \"I have just come from the pork butcher\", afterwards tipped over into these appositions which were no longer assumable by the subject, with the word \"sow\", which could no longer be integrated by the subject beyond, and by its own movement, through its own inertia as signifier, tipped over to the other side drawn by the reply, into the other. It was purely and simply elementary phenomenology. It is a question of seeing why, and moreover after all one fails to see what it is a question of by excluding what happens betwe en the message and the other, is going to have as a result the two major categories of voices and hallucinations which Schreber has, namely the emission here at the level of the other, of signifiers of the fundamental tongue, namely of what presents itself as such, therefore as the broken and original elements of the code, which can be articulated only with respect to one another, because this fundamental language is organised in such a way, that literally it covers the world with its network of signifiers, without anything else being sure and certain there, except that it is a question of the total essential signification. Every one of these words has its own weight, its own accent, its importance as a signifier. The subject articulates them with respect to one another. Whenever they are isolated, the properly enigmatic dimension of signification, in so far as it is infinitely less evident than the certainty that it involves, is something quite striking. In other words, the other only emits, as I might say, beyond the code without any possibility of integrating into it this something which can come from here, namely from the place where the subject articulates his message. And from another angle, especially provided that you replace the little arrows here, there is going to come this something which would not be in any case the authentication of the message, namely the return from the other qua support of the code regarding the message, in order to integrate, to authenticate it in the code with any intention whatsoever, but which of course will also come from the other like every message, because there is no way that a message can start, except from the other, even though   it begins from us as a reflection of the other, because it is constructed with a tongue which is the tongue of the other. This message therefore will begin from the Other here, and will leave this reference point in order to be articulated in this sort of remark: \"And now I want to give you .....\"; \" Specifically I want myself .....\"; \"And now this should nevertheless....\". What is lacking in all of this? The principal thought which is expressed at the level of the fundamental tongue, the voices themselves who understand all the theory, the voices themselves who also say: \"We need to reflect more.\" That means that from the other there begin in effect messages of the other category of messages. It is properly speaking a message which as such, is not possible to ratify, a message which manifests itself also in the pure and broken dimension of the signifier, something which only implies its signification beyond itself, something which because of the fact of not being able to participate in this authentication by the \"thou\", presents itself as something which has no other object than to present as absent this position of the \"thou\" in which signification is authenticated, because of course the subject tries to complete this signification. He therefore gives the complements of his sentences: \"I do not now want\", say the voices, that is situated elsewhere. It is said elsewhere that he, Schreber, cannot admit that he is a whore, eine Hure . Not everything is pronounced, the message remains broken here in so far as precisely it cannot pass through the voice at all, it can only come to the level of the message as an interrupted message. I think that I have sufficiently indicated to you that the essential dimension which develops and which imposes itself on the other, in so far as he is the resting place, the treasury of the signifier, involves in order that he can fully exercise his function as other the following, that in the passage of the signifier, there should be this signifier of the other, qua other. Why? I mean in so far as the other also has precisely beyond him this other, in so far as it is capable of giving a basis to the law. But it is a dimension which is of the order of signifier of course, which is incarnated in people who will or will not support this authority. But the fact for example that on occasion the people are missing, that there is a paternal lack in the sense for example that the father is too inept, is something which in itself is not the essential thing. What is essential, is that the subject, from somewhere or other, should have acquired the dimension of the name of the fathe r. Of course, what happens effectively, what you can pick up in biographical details, is that the father precisely is often there to do the dishes in the kitchen, wearing his wife\\'s apron. This is not at all the kind of thing that is enough to determine a schizophrenia. I am going to put forward to you the little schema by means of which I want to introduce for the next time the following: it is what is going to enable us to make the connection between this distinction which may appear to you a bit academic between the name of the father, and the real father, between the name of the father in so far as it may on occasion be lacking, and the father who does not appear so much to need to be there in order not to be missing. I am going therefore to introduce what will be the object of my lecture the next day, namely what I entitle from today, the paternal metaphor. The fact is that of course a name is never just a signifier like the others. It is very important to have it, but that does not mean for all that that one accedes to it any more than to the satisfaction of desire which in principle is cuckolded, about which I spoke to you above.   That is why in the act, this famous act of speech that Madame Pankow spoke to us about yesterday, it is in the dimension that we call metaphorical, that there is going to be realised concretely, psychologically the evocation that I spoke to you about above. In other words, it is necessary to have the name of the father, but it is also necessary to know how to use it, and it is from this, it is on that that the fate and the outcome of the whole affair may depend to a large extent. The real words which take place around the subject, specifically in his childhood, but the essence of the paternal metaphor that I am announcing to you today, we will speak about it at greater length the next time, consists in a triangle: And we have the schema: and everything which is realised in the S, depends on the signifiers that are posed in O. The O, if it really is the locus of the signifier, must carry some reflection of this essential signifier which I represent for you here in this zig-zag, and which I called elsewhere (in my article on \"The Agency of the Letter\") the schema L. It is necessary that something at least should be distinguished here, something which distinguishes at least these four cardinal points. We have three of them which are given by the three subjective terms of the Oedipus complex qua signifier, at each vertix of the triangle. And this is what I will come back to the next time. I am asking you for the moment, this is just a question of whetting your appetite, to accept what I am saying to you. The fourth term, is in effect the S. But because it is him, and because he - not only do I grant it do you, but this is our starting point - is in effect unspeakably stupid, he does not have his own signifier. In the three vertices of the oedipal triangle he is outside, he depends on what is going to happen in this interplay, and he is the mort in the game. It is even because the game is structured like that, I mean that it is carried on not just as a particular game, but as a game establishing itself as the rule, that the subject is going to find himself depending on the three poles which are called the ego ideal, the super-ego, and reality.   But to understand this transformation of the first reading into the other, it is necessary to see that no matter how mort the subject is, because there is a subject, he is going to pay the price of this game, namely that at this unconstituted point that he is, it is going to be necessary for him to participate in it, if not with his money, perhaps he does not have any yet, at least with his hide, with his images, with all the consequences, with his imaginary structure. And the fourth term, the S, is going to be represented in something which is opposed, in the ternate to the signifiers of the Oedipus complex, namely in something which, in order for it to stick, must itself be ternary, because of course in the inventory and the baggage of images - to realise this open the books of Mr. Jung and his school - you will see that there are an endless number of them, because they sprout and they grow everywhere, there is the serpent, the dragon, tongues, the flaming eye, the green plant, the flower pot, the conciÃ¨rge ; all of these are really quite fundamental images, and undoubtedly full of signification. Only there is nothing to be done about it, if you wander around at this level, except to get lost with your little candle in the vegetating forest of primitive archetypes, and to understand something about it, it is necessary to know that for this to involve us, namely the intersubjective dialectic, it is in so far as there are three chosen images - I am articulating my thought a little strongly - which take the role of guide in all of that, which is very precisely not difficult to understand, because we have already something absolutely all prepared, and all prepared in a way to be not only the homologue, but to be confused with the base of the mother-father-child triangle, it is the relationship between the fragmented body enveloped at the same time by many of the images that we were talking about above, with the unifying function of the total image of the body, in other words the relationship of the ego and the specular image. This already gives us the base of the imaginary triangle. The other point, it is here precisely that we are going to see the effect of the paternal metaphor, the other point, I told you about it last year in my seminar on object relations, but you are going to see it taking its place now in what we are entering into this year, namely in the formations of the unconscious, this point, I think that you have recognised it from the very fact of seeing it here in the third position with the mother and the child, but you see it in another relationship which moreover I did not mask from you at all last year because it was on that that we ended, namely the relationship with the name of the father, namely that which gave rise to the birth of the phantasy of the little horse in little Hans, this third point I finally name it, I am sure that you all have it on the tips of your tongue, is nothing other than the phallus, and this is why the phallus occupies such a central place as object in the Freudian economy, which of itself is enough to show us that contemporary psychoanalysis is getting further and further away from it, and that precisely this phallus qua fundamental function to which the   subject imaginarily identifies himself, is completely avoided, by being reduced to the notion of partial object, which is absolutely not, in the Freudian economy, its original function. This phallus will bring us back at the same time to something which was not completely understood at least that is what I believe I have heard, at the end of my discourse the last time, namely to comedy. I will leave you on this theme today. In ending I simply wanted to show you in what direction and along what path this complex discourse by which I am trying to assemble all the things that we have said, is harmonised and holds together.

       "'We are going to continue our account still with the help of our little schema. Some of you are asking questions about the little diamond shaped sign as it is employed for example when I write: $ in front of o, the small other. This does not seem to me to be very complicated. But after all because some of you are asking the question, I recall that the diamond in question, is the same thing as the square of a much older and much more fundamental schema: In which there is inscribed the relationship of the subject to the other qua object of the word, and qua message of the other in this first approximation that we made of what comes from the other and encounters the barrier of the relationship o - o\\', which is the imaginary relationship. What does that mean? That means that it expresses the relationship of the barred or unbarred subject as the case may be, namely qua marked by the effect of the signifier, simply that we consider as a subject still quite simply undetermined, still not split by the Spaltung which results from the action of the signifier, the relationship therefore of this subject to something which is determined by this quadratic relationship, and which, when I write it like that, is not otherwise determined as regards the vertices of the quadrangle in question in this frame, for example of the small other, that is of the counterpart, of the imaqinary other. If I write $ with regard to demand, or $ â—Š D, it is the same thing. One does not prejudge the point in the little square at which the demand as such will intervene, namely the articulation of a need in the form of the signifier. Here we have therefore a line which is a signifying line, and undoubtedly as such, articulated. Because it is produced at the horizon of any signifying articulation, it is the fundamental backdrop for every articulation of a demand. Here (second line) it is articulated in general. However bad it may be, we have a precise articulation, a succession of signifiers, of phonemes. Behind, that is in the beyond of every signifying articulation, this represents or corresponds to the effect of the signifying line, of the signifying articulation qua caught up in its totality, from the fact that by its simple presence it makes something symbolic appear in the real. It is in its totality, and in so far as it is articulated that it makes this horizon or this possibility of demand appear, this power of the demand which is that it is essentially and of its nature a demand for love, a demand for presence, this naturally with all its ambiguities.   I say love in order to fix something. Hate in this instance has the same place. It is uniquely on this horizon that the ambivalence of hate and of love can be conceived; it is also in this horizon that we can see coming to this same point this third term really homologous to love and to hate with respect to the subject, and precisely which I found in a text and elsewhere: ignorance. It is here then that there is found the signifier of O, qua marked by the action of the siqnifier, namely of O barred, namely that at this precise point which is the homologue of the point where on the line of demand there appears in this fundamental schema of every demand, this return of the passage of the demand through the other which is called the message. If you like, in a homologous fashion, what has to be produced at the point of the message in the second line, is precisely this message of a signifier, signifying that the other is marked by the signifier. That does not mean that this message is produced. It is there at a homologous point as the possibility of being produced. And on the other hand, a point homologous to this point at which the demand arrives at the other, namely where it is submitted to the existence of the code in the other, at the locus of the other, at the locus of the word. You also have at this horizon, what can be produced which is called this reference, which is called this conscious awareness ( prise de conscience ). But it is not simply conscious awareness, this articulation by the subject qua speaker of somethinq which is his demand as such, and with respect to which he situates himself. That this should be capable of being produced, is the fundamental presupposition of analysis itself. It is what is produced in the forefront of analysis. It is not, not essentially and as a first step, the renewal by the subject of his demands. Of course in a certain fashion it is a renewal, but it is an articulated renewal; it is in his discourse that the subject in a certain fashion makes appear, either directly, or in filigree running through his discourse, which is undoubtedly much more important for us when it is in filigree than when it is renewed directly by the form and the nature of his demand, namely by the signifiers in which this demand is formulated. And it is in so far as this demand is formulated in archaic signifiers than we talk about anal, or oral regression, for example. I remind you that the last time, what I articulated, what I wished to introduce, is that everything that is produced which is properly speaking of the nature of transference, depends on the existence of this line behind, of this line which begins from a point whose start we can give by Î¦, and which ends with a â—Š, whose meaning we will make more precise subsequently with respect to this line Î¦ -- of â—Š, which it is the origin, the foundation.   The foundation of this effect of the signifier as such in the subjective economy, it is in so far as something is situated with respect to this line that one can talk about transference, namely that everything which is of the order of transference, according to the action or the inaction of the analyst, according to his abstention or his non-abstention, always tends to operate in this intermediary zone, and can always in a certain fashion be brought back to the articulation of the demand. In a certain fashion, of course at every instant it is I would say normal, it is in the nature of verbal articulation in analysis, that something should be articulated on the plane of demand. But if precisely the analytic law is that no demand of the subject shall be satisfied, it is precisely for no other reason than that we speculate on the fact that in analysis something will be produced which will tend to make this line of demand operate, not on the plane of a precise, formulated, satisfied or not satisfied, demand. Everybody agrees: it is not because we frustrate the subject of what he may demand of us on occasion, whether it is the extreme case of wanting to kiss our hands, or whether it is simply to answer him; it is not that which operates, it is a more profound frustration, belonging to the nature, to the essence of the word in so far as it itself causes to arise this horizon of demand, and it is always in sum at the level of this horizon which I called very simply, to fix your ideas, the demand for love, and which, as you see, may also be a demand for something else, maybe a certain demand concerning the recognition of his being, with all the conflicts that this gives rise to, in as much as the analyst by his presence and qua counterpart, denies it. The Hegelian negation of the relationship of consciences, is also glimpsed here on this occasion: the demand to know. This naturally exists at the horizon of the analytic relationship. The reason why this interests us, the reason why this is involved in the symptoms, the reason why this serves for the resolution of neuroses, is to the extent that it is in this topological relationship with these two lines in so far as they are formed by every articulation of the word in analysis, that there are situated the four vertices of this other locus of reference of the subject to the other which is the imaginary locus of reference; in so far as here they are only false vertices. They are realised by the narcissistic or specular relationship of the ego to the image of the other, in so far as it is already on this side, anterior to, entirely implied in the first relationship of demand, and that beyond it is in the intermediary zone between the articulated demand and its essential horizon, also articulated of course, because it is the zone of all the articulations that are involved, also articulated as such because it is supported by what is articulated; but which does not of course mean articulatable, because here what is at the horizon, and strictly speaking this last term in so far as nothing suffices to formulate it in a completely satisfying fashion, except by the indefinite continuation of the development of the ......... It is in this intermediary zone that there is situated this something which is called desire, desire in so far as it interests us, desire in so far as it is desire which is properly speaking put in question in the whole economy of the subject, and can be involved in what is revealed in analysis, namely in everythinq that in the word begins to move in this oscillating interplay between what I might call the down- to-earth signifiers of need, and all that results beyond the articulation of this signifier, from the constant presence of the signifier qua present in the unconscious of the subject, namely in so far as it has already moulded, formed, structured the subject, it is here in this intermediary zone, and I have told you why, that desire is situated, the desire of man in so far as it is the desire of the other, namely that it is beyond   the passage of the articulation of man\\'s need in this necessity to make it known to the other, this desire in the form of absolute condition, of something which is beyond every satisfaction of need, and which is produced in the margin which exists between the demand for the satisfaction of need and the demand for love, which is situated there. It is the problematic of this desire in so far as the desire of man is always to be sought by him in the locus of the other and which means that desire is a desire structured in this locus of the other as such, and in so far as the locus of the Other is the locus of the word, which creates the whole problematic of desire, of human desire, and which makes it subject to the formations of the unconscious, to the dialectic of the unconscious, which means that we deal with it, that we can have an influence on it by the fact that it is or not articulated in the word in analysis. There would be no analysis if there were not this fundamental situation. This having been said, we have what is, as one might say, its correspondent, its support, the point where it fixes its object which far from being some sort of natural object, is an object that is always constituted by a certain position taken up by the subject in relation to the other. It is with the help of this relationship which is phantastical in its essence, in its nature, that man finds himself and situates his desire, hence the importance of phantasies, hence the fact that in Freud you will see how rarely the term instinct is employed. It is always a question of drives, in other words of something which is a technical term given to this desire, in so far as the word isolates it, fragments it and puts it in this problematic and disjointed relationship with its proper goal, namely what is called the distinction ( direction ) between the tendency and its object. On the other hand you know that it is essentially made up of substitution, of displacement, indeed all the forms of transformation and equivalence essentially subjected to the word. We had arrived the last time at the attempt to centre the problems more closely around something which must have a relationship with what is said there, because after all elements of it come through in the studies, especially of the nature of obsessional neurosis which I advised you on several occasions to get to know by your own efforts, and it is certain that certain elements: term, distance from the object, phallic object, relationship to the object, which are involved in it, cannot fail, at least in the report after these studies, to provoke us to see how we can judge them, assess them in the light of what this brings. The last time therefore I took from the point of view of the treatment relationship, two cases of obsessional neurosis, in the article: \" Importance de l\\'aspect homosexuel du transfert \" (the case of Catherine .........., a false obsessional). I pointed out to you how problematic in a certain way there appears the result of one or other of the suggestions, we could say directives, or even let us say strictly speaking interpretations, which are given in this phantasy. I pointed out to you in connection with a dream for example, how because of certain presuppositions one finds simplified in the system, one comes to avoid certain outstanding elements, and therefore the dream itself. Mention was made of a homosexual transference d ream, as if this itself could have a meaning when the dream itself gives the image of what is involved, namely a relationship which is far from being a dual one, in as much as I showed you in the quite piquant presence here in the form of an object, of an object which is in this instance the famous bidet mentioned in this dream, the subject then who in this dream was transported into the bed of the analyst, who is both at his ease there, in an attitude which one can describe, in accordance with the manifest   content of the dream, as one of expectation, but with the quite articulated and essential presence of this bidet (lit). One may be all the more astonished that the analyst does not pay attention to this, because another text of the same analyst shows that he is far from ignoring the strictly phallic signification of what certain analysts have called the hollowed out or cup -like penis, in so far as it is one of the forms under which the signifier phallus can present itself at the level of the assumption of the phallic image by the feminine subject. In fact this sort of grail which is presented here for us in the dream, is clearly something which is at the very least destined to stimulate the attention, indeed to give rise to some prudence in someone who inte rprets this dream in terms of a twofold relationship. I would go further: this observation No.2, I reread it once more, I also read the one which precedes it. It really seems to me that this is not the most important thing, for one to criticise, because it is really taken to this really obvious level. I would simply ask you to reread this observation. Let us take all the same at random for example this sentence: I alluded then to a second phase of the analysis, when an intervention of this kind had previously taken place, but I come back to it because in a way the subject who had been really been drawn by the fact to a deepening of the transference ....... the transference situation became more and more precise. It was necessary to insist in order to overcome certain silences. The transference became then frankly homosexual....... I alluded therefore to the fact that if it exists, it is a question of facilitating affectionate relationships between men which are designated by the name of friendship, and that everybody knows that these relationships always take on a certain passive character for one of the partners, when the one who finds himself in the necessity of having to receive directives ...... At that difficult moment I had the idea of using an analogy which could be understood right away by this ex-officer. Why do men go to their death for a leader whom they love, .... because they accept orders and commands with an absolute sense of obedience; they thus experience the feelings and the thoughts of their leader so strongly, that they identify with him and sacrifice their lives as he himself would do if he found himself in their place. You see that an intervention of this kind should demand a fairly serious piece of silence. \"They can only act in this way because they love their leader passively.\" \"This remark did not cause all reservations to disappear immediately, but it allowed him to continue to be objective, even though he was going to re-live with me other homosexual situations, more precise than these.\" And in effect this does not fail to occur. In fact it is quite clear that the fact of orientinq, of facilitating, of opening the door to a whole imaginary elaboration in what is called the twofold relationship between the analyst and the analysand, in a fashion which is shown by the observation itself to be not simply systematic, but really insistent, and in these two terms, on the two planes it chooses everything which, in the material, goes in the simplifying direction of elaborating the twofold relationship in so far as it is provided with an analytic signification.   Here it is not even a question of this element on which I will subsequently insist, namely the role of the stamp given to interpretation by the introduction of a signifier. Here interpretation, namely what makes it necessary that interpretation should be something that of its nature should be brief, is precisely this: it is that it essentially is, and that it should be essentially centred on the handling of the signifier. What do we have here? We have manifestly an intervention in the very paragraph we are considering. It shows the meaningful, comprehensive, persuasive character which consists in inducing the subject to live precisely this relationship which as such is articulated and considered at this level of the work of the author as a twofold relationship, exactly for him to articulate the notion of the analytic situation as such, as a simple relationship which he elsewhere calls a two-fold relationship. Here we find ourselves in the clearest fashion - everyone can put his finger on it, you do not even need to be an analyst to perceive it - before something which of its nature is close to suggestion, which in any case by the very fact that it chooses a signification to which it returns on three occasions, even in this observation which is about six pages long, shows us the essential stages of this relationship of the analyst to the person in analysis, and presents itself in the form of a facilitation of the understanding of the twofold situation in terms of homosexual relationships, as they are classically presented to us in the Freudian doctrine as being this something libidinal which underlies every relationship considered from a social angle, namely in this highly ambiguous form which does not allow to be distinguished what is strictly speaking the homosexual drive in so far as it is distinct in the choice of an erotic object, that of the sex opposite to the one which the norm may wish for. There is here something of a different nature to the use of the term homosexual in connection with this libidinal underpinning. This no doubt poses all sorts of problems, but their use in the form of an indoctrination within the therapy, I am not saying that it is illegitimate in itself, I am saying that the fact that it is systematic assuredly poses the problem of the whole orientation, of the whole direction of the treatment. Because in fact we see clearly the degree to which this can have an effect, but do you not at the same time also see that there is here a j choice in the mode of intervention in connection with obsessional neurosis, and that everything that you otherwise know about obsessional neurosis, clearly reminds you that this relationship of the subject to himself, to his existence in the world, which is called an obsessional neurosis, is something infinitely more complex in every way, than a relationship of libidinal attachment to a subject of his own sex, at whatever level he manages to articulate it. Everyone knows, since Freud\\'s first observations, the role played by the destructive drive directed against the counterpart and redirected by this very fact against the subject himself. Everyone knows that many other elements are involved in it; these elements of regression, of fixation in libidinal evolution which are moreover far from being as simple, and I would say even embarrassing, as the famous link between the sadistic and the anal, is not something which of itself can be held to be simple, or even to have been simply elucidated at some moment or other. In short, everything shows that if such an orientation or direction of the treatment pursued has an effect, it is precisely something with a much wider perspective on what is in question, something which comes to be articulated. I do not say that this is entirely sufficient, but already it permits us to organise better the different planes and registers on which things can effectively be organised.   At the level of this plane, we can see, we can in effect situate this something which is a detail in the economy of the obsessional, namely the role played at one point of this economy, by the identification to an other who is a small o, an imaginary other, and that it is one of the modes thanks to which he balances more or less well or badly his economy as an obsessional. To go too far as one might say in this direction, to give him this sort of satisfaction which is the ratification of this relationship, there appears in the history of the subject, the frequency, I would say the consistency in the history of the obsessional, of an other in so far as he is the one to whom he refers, whose approbation and criticism he demands, with whom he identifies as someone. The author in question articulates it as someone stronger than him, and on whom literally one can say that he bases himself, a sort of dream. This is something that is well known: the fact of sanctioning as one might say this mechanism, which is undoubtedly strictly speaking a mechanism of defence in this instance, the way in which the subject balances the problematic of his relationship to the desire of the other, is something which can have some therapeutic effect, but far from having one all by itself, and moreover does not the subsequent development of the works of the author show that things pushed in this sense, which more and more put the accent on what he calls on this occasion the distance from the object, this is incarnated in something which is produced, which is very specially centred around the phantasy of fellatio; the fellatio of a phallus, not just any phallus but very precisely the phallus which is a part of the imagined body of the analyst. This culminates in the elaboration in a way of a sort of phantasy in which this sort of imaginary support based on the counterpart and in the homosexual other, is incarnated, is materialised in this imaginary experience which is proposed to us as being as such comparable to Catholic communion, to the consumption of a host. We see here that always along the same line, along a certain line of the elaboration of the phantasy, this time still more exaggerated, that there is produced something where we then undoubtedly see, where we can materialise it on the schema that we are dealing with. It is a question of the production of what happens at the level of the original phantastical productions. I am going to show you that it is exactly from the subject himself, of the passage from this, namely from the relationship $ â—Š o, in so far as it is at the level of the phantasy, namely of the phantastical production which allowed the subject to situate himself, to reach an arrangement with his desire, of the passage from this to the level of the message strictly speaking, of the message which is that of the reply to the demand, of the message, in so far as it is situated - it is not for nothing that in the observation, you are going to see it - is articulated in this fashion, we see at that moment appearing the image of the good mother, of the benevolent mother, and that we are told about the allaying of the infantile feminine superego. In effect it is in so far as it is at the level of the signification of the signified of the Other (O ). Ratifying this phantastical production of the subject, in a way it is this which we can literally only properly express except as a reduction of the complexity of the formations in the subject which desire is, as a reduction of this to the relationship of demand, of demand articulated in the direct relationship of the subject to the analyst. You will say to me: but if it succeeds? In effect, why not? Do we not even have here a certain notion that one can have of analysis?   I reply: not only does it not suffice, but we have in these observations, moreover in the most perceptible fashion, in what we are given, we also have in addition documents which allow us to see by experience what the result of this is. Undoubtedly this has certain effects, but on the other hand what is produced is something which is very far from representing the healing that we could expect, or the pretended genital maturation which is supposed to be realised. How can we fail to see the paradox that is represented by the fact of speaking about genital maturity when in fact it is frankly articulated here that genital maturity is represented on this occasion by the fact that the subject allows himself to be loved by his analyst? There is all the same something extraordinary here; far from genital maturity being realised by a process, we see here on the contrary very obviously the occurrence of a subjective reduction of symptoms by the mediation of a process which of its nature, has something regressive about it, not regressive only in the temporal sense but regressive from the topographical point of view, in as much as there is a reduction to the plane of demand of everything that is of the order of the production, of the organisation, of the maintenance of desire. And effectively, what is produced in these stages, far from being interpretable as it sometimes is in the direction of an amelioration, in the sense of a normalisation of relationships with the other, shows itself as brusque explosions, or acting out - I showed it to you last year in connection with an observation, the observation of relationships in a subject strongly marked by perverse tendencies, and where things ended up in a true acting out with the subject going to observe through toilet doors, women urinating, namely literally going to find the woman precisely qua phallus, namely by a sort of brusque explosion of something which, under the influence of the demand is excluded, and which here re -enters in the form of something which strictly speaking in this quite isolated act in the life of the subject, has all the compulsive forms of acting out, and the presentifying of a signifier as such. Many more testimonies still show us in other forms, sometimes for example in the form of a falling in love which itself has this paradoxical aspect in these subjects that there is no reason for considering them in themselves as being dissident homosexuals; the homosexuality they have, they have or do not have any more than what one can see of it in a sudden falling in love with one\\'s counterpart, in a problematic falling in love, I would say in a really artificial production of these sorts of interventions, in a falling in love which in effect takes on the appearance of a homosexual falling in love, and which is only in fact the forced production as one might say of this relationship $ with respect to o, which in this sort of way of orienting, of d irecting an analysis, is properly speaking what was forced by the reduction to demand. I would therefore say that at this level of this practice, this fashion really which at that moment one can say lacks all criticism, all subtlety, there is something which discourages any commentary, and that is also why I would like to take something which is still earlier, and which, as I told you once, in the work of the author in question, always seemed to me much more interesting and suitable for showing what development perhaps might have taken place, if his elaboration of these subjects had been differently oriented. It is the one which concerns the therapeutic incidences of conscious awareness ( prise de conscience ). It is the very title of L\\'Envie du penis dans la nÃ©vrose obsessionnelle fÃ©minine .   This observation is very interesting because we do not have many analyses of obsessional neuroses in women, and also for those who may approach the problem of the sexual specificity of neurosis, namely who think that it is for reasons connected with their sex, that subjects choose one or other angle of neurosis. We will see all the same in this instance of feminine obsessional neurosis, how everything that is of the order of structure in neurosis, is something which allows very little place to the determination that the sexual position, in the sense of natural sexual position, in the sense of natural, biological sex, can have. Here in fact this famous prevalence of the phallic object as such that we saw operating in the observations concerning masculine obsessional neuroses, is found again, and in a very interesting fashion. Here is how the author on this occasion, conceives, discovers, develops the progress of the analysis. He articulates it himself in the following fashion: Like the masculine obsessional, the woman needs to identify herself in a regressive way with the man in order to free herself from the anxieties of early childhood. But while the former depends on this identification in order to transform the infantile love object into a genital love object..... This corresponds strictly to what I remarked above about the paradox of the identification of the masculine subject to the analyst in this instance, because just by itself it constitutes this passage from the infantile love object to the object of genital love. There is certainly here something which at least poses a problem: She (the woman) bases herself at first on this same identification and tends to abandon this first object and to orientate herself towards a heterosexual fixation, as if she could proceed to a new feminine identification, this time onto the person of the analyst. It is therefore said with an ambiguity that is undoubtedly striking, but necessary, that it is the identification to the analyst articulated here as such, which is defined as such. It is noted that he is of the masculine sex, that it is this identification which in the first case, of itself, is simply supposed as self-evident, this identification, assures the access to genitality, whence it results, if one has this presupposition, this hypothesis, that in the case of the woman, if we obtain what is given as being the case, however not without some prudence, because in this observation no extraordinary amelioration is noted, but undoubtedly it is established that in the very measure of this identification to the analyst, it is established not without a certain embarrassment, not without a certain surprise even, that this identification will be successively carried out in fact in two modes: in a first mode which will be first of all conflictual, namely of complaints against men, of hostility even with respect to men, then in the very measure that this relationship, we are told, allays, a particular problematic. It is always because of the necessity of conceiving in a certain fashion this progress of a feminine identification, which is admitted as possible, by reason, we are told, of the fundamental ambiguity of the person of the analyst. We are certainly not satisfied for all that with this explanation. ... a new identification, this time feminine, this time onto the person of the analyst. It goes without saying that the interpretation of transference phenomena is particularly   delicate here, if the personality of the masculine analyst is first apprehended as that of a man, with all the interdictions, the fears, the aggressivity that this involves, shortly after the desire for phallic possession ..... And this is what we are going to have to talk about, and what we are going to have to estimate. \"... and correlatively for the castration of the analyst.\" And he adds: \"....and that because of this fact, the aforementioned effects of relaxation were obtained, the personality of the masculine analyst is assimilated to that of a benevolent mother\". And he adds again: \"Does this assimilation not show that the essential force of anti-masculine aggressivity is found in the initial destructive drive of which the mother was the object?\" Here a Kleinian horizon can always give some support. The conscious awareness of the one brings about the right to the free exercise of the other, and the liberating power of this conscious awareness of the desire for phallic possession becomes then obviously comprehensible, as well as the passage from one identification to the other in function of the fundamental ambiguity. Here we find again the sentence pronounced above. In fact it is all there. You are going to see, this is based first of all on the interpretation of what is involved, both on a requirement or on a desire for phallic possession, and correlatively for the castration of the analyst. If we look at things more closely, this is far from representing what is effectively presented in the observation. I will take up the observation in the order that it is presented to us. The patient is a fifty year old woman; healthy, mother of two children, exercising a paramedical profession. She has come because of series of obsessional phenomena which are altogether commonplace: the obsession of having contracted syphilis. This is important, in so far as she sees in this some prohibition or other directed against the marriage of her children, which however she was not able to oppose, in the case of her eldest son. Obsessions of infanticide, of poisoning, in short a whole series of obsessions which are I would say quite banal, especially in the type of obsessional manifestations in women. Before even giving us the list, it is the author himself who speaks to us in a prevalent fashion about obsessions with a religious theme. There are of course all sorts, as in all obsessions with a religious theme, insulting scatological phrases which impose themselves on the subject, in formal contradiction to her convictions.   Let us begin to look at what presents itself as one of the elements which the author himself underlines right away, in the relationships of the subject to religious reality, especially to the reality which for her, because she is a Catholic, is the presence of the body of Christ in the host. She also represents in her imagination male genital organs, without there being any question of a hallucinatory phenomenon, we are told, in the place of the host. A few lines further on an important detail concerning this principal religious schÃ©matisation of these obsessionals is pointed out to us: it is that her mother alone was responsible for her Catholic education, and her conflict with her was able to be referred onto the spiritual plane, we are told, which moreover was always of an obligatory and constraining character. I do not dispute it. This is a very important fact. Before reflecting on the mode of the interpretations which are subsequently given, I would like you to dwell for a moment on this symptom. This symptom in itself is altogether of a nature to encourage us to make some remarks. The genital organs, we are told, appear in front of and in the place of the host. What can that mean for us? For us, I mean for us analysts. Here all the same there is a case where this place, this superposition, should be given its value, if we are analysts. What do we call repression, and especially the return of the repressed, if not something which appears as something which discolours from beneath, which arises to the surface as the scriptures describe it, or like a stain which rises or which with time returns to the surface? Here is a case, where if we wish to accord their textual importance to things, as our position as analysts requires us to do, we should try to articulate what it returns from. We know that for this woman who has received a religious education, Christ should at least have a religious sense, as for all of those who are in the Christian religion, and it is not a matter of indifference. Christ is the Word, the Logos, and this is drummed into us in Catholic education, and that he is the incarnate Word, is something which is not in the least doubted, it is the most abbreviated form of what one can call a creed. We see in sum that if we refer to this Logos, what he is, namely if we are told that he is the Word, he is the Word; he is the Word, namely the totality of the Word. We see appearing through him, substituting itself for him, in his place, something which is what we, in what in a converging fashion with respect to all our exploration, we try to formulate about the analytic experience. We have been led to call this privileged signifier unique, in so far as it is defined by the fact that it designates the effect, the mark, the imprint of the signifier as such on the signified. What is produced therefore in this symptom, is the substitution for a relationship which is given to us as that of the relationship of the subject to the word, to the word in its essence, to the total word, to the incarnate word even, the substitution for the totality of this word of a privileged signifier which is properly speaking that of the signifier which serves to designate the effect, the mark, the imprint, the wound of the totality of the signifier which bears on this human subject in so far as through the agency of the signifier there are in him things which come to signify. We are going through the observation. What are we going to find further on?   To are going to find the following: that the subject is going in this instance to find herself saying that she has dreamed, that she crushed the head of Christ with her kicks, and this head, she adds, was like your own. She is speaking to the analyst. And in association, she makes the following remark: \"Every morning in order to get to work, I pass in front of an undertaker\\'s shop where four images of Christ on the cross are exposed. Looking at them I have the sensation that I am walking on their penises. I experience a sort of intense pleasure and anxiety.\" Here once again, what do we find? We find manifestly the identification of this something which is the Other, the big Other, undoubtedly in this instance the Other qua locus of the word. On this occasion what we are given, is that the subject crushes the face of Christ with her heel. Let us not forget that here Christ is materialised by an object, namely a crucifix. That this object itself in this instance should be in its totality as one might say, the phallus, is again something which cannot fail to strike us, especially if we continue to pursue the details that are given in the observation, namely the following: the fact is that something very peculiar is going to intervene in the relationships of the analysand with the analyst: the reproaches that she is going to address to the analyst, about the difficulties that he introduces into her existence by his treatment, are going to be materialised in the fact that she cannot buy shoes for herself. The analyst of course could not be so unaware as not to recognise here the phallic value of the shoe, in other words that the shoe, and especially the heel of which great use is made, very precisely on this occasion in order to crush the head of Christ, is something which has here all its import. Let us remark in this connection that this occurs within an analysis, that fetishism, especially shoe fetishism in a woman is practically never seen, the appearance of this something which is referred to the shoe with this phallic signification. On the other hand in the course of the elaboration of an observation as it is carried out in analysis, is something which here takes on all its value. Let us try to understand it. In order to understand it it is not necessary to go very far. While the analyst does everything at that moment to suggest to the subject that it is a question here of a need, of a desire to possess the phallus, which is perhaps not in itself the worst thinq that he could say, if it were not for the fact that for him this represents, as he also says, the desire of the subject to be a man. Which the subject does not fail to object to, to contest with the qreatest energy up to the end. She never had the desire to be a man, and in truth in fact it is perhaps not the same thing to desire to possess the phallus and to desire to be a man, because analytic theory itself supposes that matters can be resolved in a very natural fashion, and who would not take it into account? But here is what the analysand replies in this instance. She replies: \"When I am well dressed, men desire me, and I say to myself with a very real joy: There\\'s another one who\\'s going to pay for it. I am happy to think that they are suffering because of it.\" In short, she brings the analyst back to solid, economic earth, namely, if there is a relationship to the phallus in her relationships with men, what is it? Let us try now to articulate it ourselves.   Here more or less is how I propose to you to articulate it precisely: there are several elements here: there is the relationship to the mother, the relationship to the mother of course about which we are told that it is profoundly essential, a really coherent relationship between the real subject and this mother whose problematic relationships with the father we are shown, and we will subsequently come back to her relationships with the father, and to the relationships of the patient with her father, that this mother in any case showed herself in several ways, and in particular in the following way: that the father was not able to overcome the attachment of his wife to a first love, which was moreover a Platonic one. For something like this to be pointed out in the observation, means that it must have had a certain place. We see here on the other hand that the relationships of the subject to the mother are these: she judges her favourably in every way, more intelligent than the father, etc..., fascinated by her energy, etc...: The rare moments when her mother relaxed filled her with an unspeakable joy she had always considered that her younger sister was preferred to her. As well as that however anybody who interfered with this union with her mother was the object of a death wish, as is demonstrated by a large amount of material, either from dreams, or from childhood, relating to the desire for the death of her sister. Is this not enough to demonstrate that first and foremost everything that in this instance is in question in the relationships of the subject to her mother, is precisely what I underlined for you as being the relationship of the subject to the desire of the mother. The fashion in which the problem of desire is introduced into the life of the subject is precocious and particularly manifest, precisely in the history of the obsessional. This desire which culminates in the fact that the subject sees being outlined as an end, the end not of having this or that, but first of all of being the object of the desire of the mother, with what this involves, namely of deducing what exists, but is unknown. The object of the desire of the mother, is precisely that on which there depends everything which from now on links for the subject the approach of her own desire to a destructive effect, and that which at the same time subordinates, defines as one might say, the approach of this desire as such to the signifier which is precisely by itself the signifier of the effect of desire in the life of the subject, namely the phallus. I am articulating things afresh: the problem is not for the subject in question of knowing whether the mother, as in the case of the phobic for example, has or does not have the phallus. It is to know what is the effect in the other of this something which is X, which is desire. And in other words, what comes to the forefront for the subject, is to know what she will be, whether she is or is not, that which the desire of the other is. What we see here coming to the forefront, and very precisely in this connection, it is very nice to see it on this occasion is the substitution at this point and at this level of the signifier phallus as such for the incarnate Logos, namely for the other, for the other in so far precisely as the word marks him. In other words, I will articulate my thought still further: Freud saw and designated the frontiers of analysis as stopping, as I might say, at this point which in certain cases, he says, proves to be irreducible, there descends on the subject a sort of wound which for the man is the castration complex, and which keeps all its predominant manifestations, which in short can be resumed as follows: that he cannot have the phallus except against the background of   not having it, which is exactly the same thing as what appears in the woman, namely that she does not have the phallus except against the background of the following: that she has it, because otherwise how could she be so enraged by this irreducible Penisneid . Do not forget that Neid in German, does not simply mean a wish, Neid means that which literally enrages me. All the underlay of aggression and of anger are indeed in this original Neid , in modern German and much more still in the old forms of German, and even of Anglo-Saxan. If Freud in a certain fashion marked here what he called on a certain occasion the infinite character, projected to infinity, which is badly translated by interminable, of what can happen in analysis, it is because he does not see, because after all there were things in the face of which he did not have the opportunity of doing, even though many things indicate, especially in the last article on the Spaltung of the ego to which I will return, he does not see that the solution to the problem of castration in man as in woman, is not about this dilemma of having or of not having the phallus, because it is only starting from the moment when the subject perceives that there is one thing which in any case must be recognised and stated, that he is not the phallus, and it is starting from this realisation in analysis that the subject is not the phallus, that he can normalise what I would call this natural position, that either he has it, or that he does not have it. This is therefore effectively the final term, the signifying relationship around which there can be resolved the imaginary impasse engendered by the function that the image of the phallus comes to take on at the level of the signifying plane, and this indeed is what happens in our subject when, under the effect of the first manifestations of being taken up into the mechanism of transference, namely of a more elaborated articulation of symptomatic effects that there is produced in her something which is produced in an entirely recognisable fashion in what I have just quoted for you today, namely the following: I am saying that the phantasy qua presentified in the analysis, which is linked to the possession or the non-possession of shoes, of feminine shoes, of phallic shoes, of shoes which we will on this occasion call fetishistic, what function does it take for a masculine subject in so far as in his perversion, what he refuses, is that the woman should be castrated? This is what the fetishistic perversion means for the masculine subject: the perversion, is to affirm that the woman has it against the background of what she does not have. Without this there would be no need for an object, to present her with an object over and above, manifestly independent of the woman\\'s body. If the woman begins to develop in the course of the transferential elaboration, something which is apparently the same thing, namely that she has it, because what she underlines is that she wishes to have it in the form of clothes, in the form of those clothes which are going to excite men\\'s desire, and thanks to which she can disappoint them in their desire. She is the one who articulates it in that way. Undoubtedly she is apparently stating the same thing, but it is something quite different when it is posed by the subject herself, namely by the woman, rather than by the man who confronts her, and also for her on this occasion, what she shows, is that by wishing to present herself as having what she herself knows perfectly well she does not have, it is a matter there of something which for her has a quite different value, namely what I called the value of a masquerade, and that through which, for all that, she makes of her femininity precisely a mask. What is in question, is that starting from the fact that this phallus which is for her the signifier of desire, what is in question is that she should present its appearance, that she should appear to be it. What is in question, is that she should be the object of a desire, and of   a desire that she herself knows very well she can only disappoint. She expresses it formally at the moment that the analyst interprets what is in question to her as a desire for the possession of the phallus. It is a question here of something which once more shows us the divergence which is established, and which is essential, between being this something which is the object of the desire of the other, and the fact of having or of not having the organ which bears its mark. We come therefore to the following formula: the original desire, is: I want to be what she, the mother, desires. In order to be it I must destroy that which for the moment is the object of her desire. The subject wishes to be what this desire is. What she must be led to see in the treatment, is that it is not in himself that the man is it, the object of this desire; it is to show her precisely that the man is no more the phallus than the woman. What causes her aggressivity - I will show it to you better the next time - with regard to her husband qua man, is in so far as she considers that he is, I do not say that he has, that he is the phallus, and it is under this heading that he is her rival, it is under this heading that his relationships with her are marked by the sign of obsessional destruction. That this desire of destruction is turned against herself in accordance with the essential form of the obsessional economy, this indeed in effect is the goal of the treatment, it is namely to make her see that: you yourself are what you wish to destroy, in so far as you also wish to be the phallus; and what is done in a certain way of carrying on the treatment? Notice the difference: you are what you wish to destroy; it is replaced by: you wish to destroy what in this instance is taken up into quite improbable and fleeting phantasies. The details of the observation will show you this destruction of the phallus of the analyst. You wish to destroy this, says the analyst, and I myself give it to you. In other words, the treatment is entirely conceived as being the fact that the analyst phantastically gives, consents as one might say, to a desire for phallic possession. Now, that is not what is in question, and one proof among others that one can give that it is not that, is the fashion in which, at the quasi-terminal point to which the analysis seems to have been pursued then, we are told that the patient holds on to all her obsessions, apart from the fact that she no longer has but one of them. They have all been ratified, in block, by the analysis, of course, but the fact that they still exist has all the same some importance. What does the patient do? This is said in the observation with a complete ignorance. She intervenes with all her energy with her eldest son of whom she has always been terrified, because in fact he is the only one whose masculine reactions she had never completely succeeded in mastering, telling him that he must as a matter of urgency go and have himself analysed in his turn, namely that this phallus that the analyst believes to be the solution of the situation, in so far as taking, as he says himself, the position of the benevolent mother, he gives the phallus to this patient; she gives it back to him, namely at the only point at which she effectively has the phallus, she gives it back to him. What is lent must be repaid. The analyst has entirely oriented the analysis towards the term that the person in analysis wishes to be a man. Up to the end the person in analysis is not entirely convinced. Undoubtedly however, something which is involved, namely that it is true that the possession or not of this phallus was calmed down in this case. But the basis, the essential, the signification of the phallus in so far as it is that of desire, remains unresolved. '"
